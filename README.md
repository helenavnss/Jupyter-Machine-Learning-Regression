# Jupyter-Machine-Learning-Regression
In this repository, data was fetched from two csv files, cleansed through data pipelines in MongoDB. The data set includes numerous movies with various metrics and dimensions. The dataset was outer joined to only show movies that were in both csv files. This jupyter file is in efforts to cleanse, analyze, and visualize the data to make conclusions about many metrics regarding movies. Machine learning was also introduced to analyze the overall sentiment of the movie description. Whether that is happy, sad. or neutral on a number-based scale. Lastly, charting and cocnlusions were made based off the visualizations made.
